        <h2>This easy cinnamon bun recipe is a prime example that Swedes know how to live.</h2>
        <p>This recipe puts a lot of the cinnamon sugar on the top, rather than hidden away inside. Don’t be shy, really go for it.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <h4><strong>For the cinnamon bun dough</strong></h4>
        <ul>
            <li>100g unsalted butter</li>
            <li>200ml milk</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt</li>
            <li>250g plain or wholemeal plain flour</li>
            <li>250g strong white flour</li>
            <li>1½ tsp fast-action yeast</li>
            <li>4 tbsp caster sugar</li>
            <li>2 free-range eggs</li>
            <li>olive oil, for greasing</li>
        </ul>

        <h4><strong>For the filling and topping</strong></h4>
        <ul>
            <li>75g unsalted butter</li>
            <li>100g  caster sugar</li>
            <li>2 tbsp cinnamon</li>
            <li>1 free-range egg, beaten</li>
            
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the butter, milk and salt in a saucepan until the butter has melted. Allow to cool.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine the flours, yeast and sugar.</li>
            <li>Make a well in the centre and crack in the eggs. Pour in the lukewarm milk mixture and stir to form a sticky dough.</li>
            <li>Oil your work surface with 1 teaspoon of olive oil and knead the dough vigorously for 5-8 minutes. Don't be tempted to add flour as the dough will eventually become less sticky.</li>
            <li>Shape into a ball, and put into a large, greased bowl. Cover with a tea towel and allow to prove for an hour, or until doubled in size.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, for the filling and topping, combine the softened butter with half the sugar and 1 tablespoon of cinnamon.</li>
            <li>Mix the remaining sugar and cinnamon in a separate bowl and set aside.</li>
            <li>On a floured work surface, roll out the risen dough into a 36x24cm rectangle. Evenly spread the cinnamon-sugar-butter.</li>
            <li>With the longest edge closest to you, roll the dough into a cylinder. Cut into 12 even slices.</li>
            <li>Place each slice onto a flattened paper cupcake case on a baking tray and cover with a clean teas towel to prove for 30-45 minutes, or until risen.</li>
            <li>Pre-heat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6.</li>
            <li>Brush the tops of the buns with beaten egg and dust with the cinnamon sugar. Bake for 12 minutes until the bins are dark golden-brown.</li>
        </ol>
