        <h2>Oyakodon is a classic comfort food of Japanese home cooking.</h2>
        <p>Tender pieces of chicken, onion, and eggs, simmered in an umami-rich, dashi-based sauce and served  over a bowl of fluffy steamed rice. Simple, delicious, comforting.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>120g onion</li>
            <li>285g boneless, skinless chicken thighs</li>
            <li>1 tbsp sake</li>
            <li>4 free-range eggs</li>
        </ul>

        <h4><strong>For the dashi-based sauce</strong></h4>
        <ul>
            <li>120ml dashi</li>
            <li>2 tbsp soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 tbsp mirin</li>
            <li>2 tsp sugar</li>
        </ul>

        <h4><strong>For serving</strong></h4>
        <ul>
            <li>250g cooked japanese rice, per serving</li>
            <li>4 thinly-sliced spring onions</li>
            <li>2 tbsp mirin</li>
            <li>2 tsp sugar</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Method</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix the dashi, soy sauce mirin and sugar until the sugar is dissolved.</li>
            <li>Slice the onion and finely chop the spring onion.</li>
            <li>Dice the chicken and marinate in the sake for five minutes.</li>
            <li>Crack the eggs into a bowl and gently whisk them, making sure <strong>not</strong> to combine the yolk and whites.</li>
            <li>With the stove off, add sliced onions to a medium frying pan in a single layer. Cover with the dashi-based sauce.</li>
            <li>Turn on the heat to medium and bring to a simmer. Once simmering, add the chicken on top of the onions.</li>
            <li>Once simmering again, lower the heat to medium-low. Cook, uncovered, for 5 minutes or until the chicken is no longer pink. Halfway through, flip the chicken.</li>
            <li>Increase the heat to medium. When the liquid starts to bubble, drizzle two-thirds of the eggs over the chicken and onions.</li>
            <li>As the eggs begin to set, add the rest of the eggs. Sprinkle the spring onion on top and cook on medium-low until the egg is done to your liking.</li>
            <li>Portion into two and serve atop rice. Drizzle the desired amount of  sauce on top.</li>
        </ol>
